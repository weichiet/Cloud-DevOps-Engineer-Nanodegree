## Course Syllabus  
**Course 1: Cloud Fundamentals**  
The cloud has become a key enabler for innovation with beneficial features like high availability, unlimited capacity, and on-demand scalability and elasticity. Learn the fundamentals of cloud computing while being introduced to compute power, security, storage, networking, messaging, and management services in the cloud. While learning the fundamentals, you will explore tools and services offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) through interactive hands-on exercises. By the end of the course, you will have deployed your first website to AWS, and you will be prepared to continue your learning journey in the Cloud Developer Nanodegree program.  

  Course Project: [Deploy Static Website on AWS](./people_counter)  
  * The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS. First, you will create an S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secure it using IAM policies. Next, you will upload the website files to your bucket and speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront. Lastly, you will access your website in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint.
